    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
        I am a person who loves to code, especially for games! I have a bachelor's degree in Game Design from Uppsala University, with a programming minor.
        I love C++ far out of proportion and will go out of my way to complicate things just so I can use it! Yes, this does mean I sort of know C, but in my opinion these are entirely different beasts.
        Currently, I am living in Stockholm, Sweden, and looking for work. Although C++ is my favorite, I am quite confident with C#, atleast in the context of the Unity Engine.
        I have also dabbled with Unreal Engine, Python, Java and briefly Javascript and HTML. I tend to learn quickly, so new languages, tools and paradigms are a welcome challange!
        I'm in love with mathematics and, if allowed, will definitely bore someone to death talking about it. This is why my name on Github is based on favorite mathematician, Leonard Euler!
        I also play the piano and love to write music, often for my own games! Maybe in the future I will post some music here too. :)
